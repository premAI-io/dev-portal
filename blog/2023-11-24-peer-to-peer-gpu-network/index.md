We're thrilled to announce the launch of the [Prem Network](https://premai.io/prem-network), a peer-to-peer network poised to transform the landscape of open source AI. Building upon the foundations laid by our recently updated [Prem App](../2023-11-15-prem-app-v0.2-released/index.md), the Prem Network is seamlessly integrated into the app, enabling users to leverage the network's capabilities with ease.

## The Vision of Prem Network

Our vision with the Prem Network is to break down the barriers in AI processing. It leverages a distributed mesh of GPU providers to optimize the processing of large, open-source models. This means individuals and smaller companies can now compete on the same playing field as 'Big AI', using technology that was previously out of reach.

## How It Works

The network operates on a simple yet effective principle: process sensitive layers locally while offloading additional workloads to peers across the network. This peer-to-peer swarm networking approach enables users to increase the size of models they can run locally, effectively turning multiple devices into a singular, powerful computational resource.
Integral to the Prem Network's prowess is its innovative tech stack, comprising Petals, Hivemind, and LibP2P. These cutting-edge technologies synergize to provide a robust and efficient backbone for our network.

- [Petals](https://petals.dev): You can then run large language models at home, BitTorrentâ€‘style. The most sensitive model layers run locally, and the network will automatically fetch the other layers from other peers.

- [LibP2P](https://libp2p.io): A foundational element, LibP2P underpins our network's communication infrastructure, ensuring secure and reliable peer-to-peer interactions within the network.

Together, these technologies empower the Prem Network to handle the complex demands of modern AI applications, making it a powerhouse for both individual enthusiasts and large-scale enterprises.

## Open to All

Echoing the inclusive spirit of our [Prem App v0.2](../2023-11-15-prem-app-v0.2-released/index.md), the Prem Network is accessible to both individuals and businesses. Whether you're an AI enthusiast, a researcher, a startup, or an enterprise, the network is designed to cater to your computational needs, without the cost and complexity of traditional setups.

## Supported Models and Security

The initial models available on the network, like Stable Beluga 2 and Falcon 180B, illustrate our commitment to providing a versatile range of options for various AI applications. Furthermore, the security of your data remains paramount, with sensitive data processed locally and only non-sensitive parts delegated to the network.

## Join the Network

 Whether you're [contributing GPU using the Prem Desktop App](https://dev.premai.io/docs/prem-app/network-mode/) or simply leveraging the network's capabilities to make peer-to-peer inference requests, the Prem Network is a powerful tool for democratizing AI. We're excited to see how the network will evolve as more users join the network and contribute their GPUs.
