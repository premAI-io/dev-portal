> We have been working on a new Developer Platform aimed at enabling companies to transition from closed-source models, like those from OpenAI, to open-source alternatives such as Mistral and Llama. Our platform offers all the necessary tools (evaluation, fine-tuning, and monitoring) to make this switch with confidence. You can check it out here: https://app.premai.io. Additionally, we have launched a new Generative AI Startup Grant Program. To learn more, visit: https://blog.premai.io/announcing-our-startup-grants-program/.
